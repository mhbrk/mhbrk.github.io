## Direct Help

Gogol Bordello 
Gives people an opportunity to find the most direct and meaningful way to help. You can buy and donate specific things, which are desperately needed by Ukraine’s defenders, or you can donate money, and we will buy the equipment. You can also leverage the site to find resources needed by those who have fled or are trying to flee the onslaught. The companies that ship it have an arrangement with the Ukrainian ministry of defense so they get all the support they need. https://www.directhelpforukraine.info/ So it ships from warehouses here to Poland, then trucked to L'viv.

Want to support the people of Ukraine?
Here are meaningful ways you can help, except donating.
The aid is needed and highly appreciated by Ukrainians. 
Your support can save lives, literally.
How to help 👇

- Share the truth:
Spread information about russian aggression, terrorism, and crimes against humanity. This is not only a Ukrainian issue. This is a threat to the whole civilized world.
Avoid fake news and rely on credible, fact-checked sources like:
  - The Kyiv Independent: https://lnkd.in/d4Ud7xMB
  - Ukrayinska Pravda: https://lnkd.in/d7HGZZ4R
  - Euromaidan Press: https://lnkd.in/dGGwz-yb
  - SPRAVDI: https://spravdi.gov.ua/en/
  - Ukraineworld: https://ukraineworld.org/
- Invest in Ukrainian businesses & hire Ukrainian specialists
Ukraine is a country of great entrepreneurs and businesses. The economic front is a high priority now. We do our best to defend ourselves and work as good, as possible, as always.
- Send Humanitarian Aid
You may help by donating goods that are on the actual needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, medical workers, and internal refugees. Lists of needed items you can find here: https://lnkd.in/eEciP-DK
- Host Ukrainians
According to The United Nations report, about 3 million Ukrainians were forced to leave their homes. You can help by offering houses to the people fleeing russian aggression. Information on how to become a host check here: https://bit.ly/34OWCDK
- Ban russia
Businesses, products, companies, celebrities of Russia remain silent or support the aggression of their regime. Cooperation with them is cooperation with a murderer. Do not contribute to terrorism.
- Stand with Ukraine
Let your friends know you are in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and demand actions to save Ukraine.
